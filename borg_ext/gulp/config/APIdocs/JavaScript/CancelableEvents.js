/** 
 * CancelableEvents is a class that allows an operation to be canceled before it is completed. 
 * 
 * In the SuiteCommerce Extensibility API, most operations have a before and after event. The operation can be canceled before it is executed by creating a component listener that subscribes to the before event. Business logic in the listener can then throw an error or return a {@link Deferred} object in the rejected state. 
 * 
 * For example, in CartComponent.js, the AddLine method is used to add a line to the cart. The beforeAddLine event occurs before the line is added and the afterAddLine events occurs after the line is added. 
 * 
 * @class
 * @hideconstructor
 * @global
