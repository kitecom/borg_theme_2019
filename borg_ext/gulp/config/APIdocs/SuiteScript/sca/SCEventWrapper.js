/**
 * Supports automatically ```before``` - ```after``` triggering events for user-defined methods to support AOP similar functionality. 
 * 
 * End-user classes like SCModel and ServiceController augments this class so they automatically trigger events for their methods.
 * 
 * These events will be prefixed with ```before:``` or ```after:```, then the provided ```name``` and last the method name. 
 * Also, listeners will receive method parameters and return value (in case of ```after:```). 
 * 
 * For example, we can hook to the time when an LiveOrder is submitted so we can customize its behavior like this:
 * 
 * ```javascript
 * Application.on('before:LiveOrder:save', function()
 * {
 *      ... do something before submitting a live order ...
 * })
 * ```
