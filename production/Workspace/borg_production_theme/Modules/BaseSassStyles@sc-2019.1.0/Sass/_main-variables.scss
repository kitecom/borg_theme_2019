// Style
//
// SuiteCommerce Advanced style is focused on a minimalist use of simple elements, typography and flat colors. This allows the design to be more streamlined and efficient. Making it easier to convey information while still looking visually appealing and approachable.
// With minimal design, elements are able to load faster and resize easily and still look sharp on high-definition screens. Additionally, elements can be responsive to different browsers across different devices.
