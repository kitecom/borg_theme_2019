// @class View
// A view is a visual unit which responsibility is to show a model instance in the DOM, event binding, view composition, etc.
// IN SuiteCommerce, Views are implemented with [Backbonejs Backbone.View](http://backbonejs.org/#View). *View* here is just
// a name to hide implementation specific details.
// The applicaiotn's layout have a *currentView* that implements a main feature and usually correspond to a stateless url.
// @extlayer

// @class Backbone.View SuiteCommerce BackboneViews implement a View so if your extension implements a Backbone.View you can pass
// such an instance to, for example, @?method setCurrentView @extends View. See [Backbonejs Backbone.View](http://backbonejs.org/#View)
