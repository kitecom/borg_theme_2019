Using isRecognized() with isLoggedIn()

There are four possible cases for using the isLoggedIn() method and isRecognized() method to correctly determine the logged in status of a user:

new (anonymous) user: isRecognized() == false and isLoggedIn() == false
registered and logged in user: isRecognized() == true and isLoggedIn() == true
user who clicked logout: isRecognized() == false and isLoggedIn() == false
user who had logged in, then closed his browser and later returns to the shop: isRecognized() == true and isLoggedIn() == false
Note This last scenario is the only case where the isRecognized() status differs from the isLoggedIn() status. In this case the user didn’t click on the logout link and is therefore still recognized but isLoggedIn() returns false.
